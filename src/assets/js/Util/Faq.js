          `Besides creating a process in which people will be able to passively benefit from this, I decided to use this opportunity to shed light on concepts of money management, such as Risk Management, as emotional control will be a big factor. Overall, sharing about the psychology of money is something I think adds a lot of value. This is done using the main channel. A support document that explains such concepts from the ground up can be found here; I definitely advise studying / understanding it!`,

          "All channels I have found feed off getting people addicted to gambling, rather than aiming to actually sustain gains. Usually, the owners of such channels even have partnerships with the bookmakers, since the bookmakers know they will make money off such people, and not the other way around. If they did have an Edge, the bookmakers would not create partnerships with them, since they would be losing money! They do not even need to charge people for those channels as the bookmakers pay them for referring such people to their websites.           ",
          `There is no channel that I am aware of that has an approach to sports betting that is using advanced concepts from trading to betting (more details in this document) but also to measure the results. For instance, we can clearly and cleanly see the profit and loss over the different days, given how stakes are also clearly specified for each bet. Most channels will just brag about wins and hide losses, to create a false impression of having some sort of knowledge; most people do not really sum up the numbers to check whether they make money or not, so if they throw a lot of fireworks, they will create that false impression. Numbers don’t lie and we will never brag about wins without showing the full extent of the outcomes, including all the losses (see the full track record here).

        `,
          `Ultimately any entity that shows a track record as cleanly as we do, should be respected, and we would be happy if there were more channels using such an analytical approach. Unfortunately, this is usually not the case. They usually have just marketing to pretend they have advantage over the market when they have nothing.

       
          `,
          `   It is challenging to show the results when people are emotional about betting and cannot understand that having some consecutive days in a row where there are losses is normal, but that is part of the education process, so we will keep showing things as objectively as I can.`,

          `However, and since the idea is that people only pay something from profits they make with us, the payment will be 25% of the overall profit. In particular, we will not charge anything for the service, unless the user is making money. This is why we only charge the 25% conditional to there being no past losses, otherwise such losses offset the 25% commission and we charge nothing. Overall, this means, in the long-term, that we charge 25% of the global profit. Either we win together, or we don’t get paid.

When this happens, there is an opportunity for profit. They want to offer as many markets as possible, without caring that much for the quality of their models that determine the odds, as they will make money anyway given the lack of mental structure or just knowledge in general of math from most people using such websites. In particular, for smaller sports or less common markets of the main sports, there are many unbelievable inefficiencies we have observed and explored over the years.
        `,
          `The reason why consistently betting on inefficient markets will give profits long-term is simple. In a casino, if people stay for too long, and keep repeating their bets, they end up losing, because of the Law of Large Numbers.

          `As explained, the Law of Large Numbers shows how the more bets we do, the less volatility we have, and the more likely we are to win. The advice is thus not to select specific types of bets but to adjust the stakes that are proposed.`,
          `I am being quite defensive in the stakes I provide, so if someone has a total amount in the account that is not actually all the money they could be using, they can just pick a constant to multiply all the stakes provided by. 
          `,
          `If I multiply all my stakes by a fixed, larger than 1, constant, I risk my portfolio blowing up more easily. A Drawdown that would have been smooth may become the end of the portfolio, so we never advise taking crazy multipliers. Risk Management is crucial, and we need to be defensive; my stakes are based on the balance I believe is correct, where we do not majorly risk the impact of a bad streak, while also having solid profits in the long-term when things normalize. 
          `,
          `We do advise, though, a smart ratio between the picked Bankroll and the amount kept in the account. This already allows implicit leverage. But it should be managed very carefully, and is more advised to people with experience in managing balances (e.g. traders, Poker players). Our bot asks what the actual portfolio size (Bankroll) is, so the person can still keep a smaller amount in the account, and implicitly use leverage that way. For example, if you have $100 in the account, and choose $1,000 as Bankroll, then you are implicitly using 10x leverage, since you will bet as if you have $1,000 while only committing $100. The returns will then be multiplied by 10. The trade-off here is that if you leave a smaller amount in the account, it becomes more likely that you need to top-up at some point since Drawdowns of 20% can happen for instance. I can still safely advise that 2x leverage can be used, since we never had a Drawdown bigger than 20%, and that is not likely to occur. We will still allow people to take different multipliers since there are always different risk appetites.

          `,
          `Note that using the stakes we propose, without any sort of leverage, we are already looking for an expected return of more than 5% per month (see Track Record ).

          `Drawdowns getting big and the account blowing up: this should be avoided, given the extremely small probability of a drawdown larger than 20%, if we do not use stakes smaller than 5x.
          `,
          `Money psychology: even if the account is not blowing up, allowing a large multiplier will imply, mainly for people less used to handling instantaneous variations in their networth (which can be a trigger for tricky behaviors), the possibility that there will be an impact in their day-to-day lives, exactly as when it comes to gambling, and we want to be responsible and restrict people from putting themselves in this dangerous path. While some people would be able to use a multiplier larger than 2x without problems, and manage their balance in a way that they could even be purposely topping-up the account as needed, there is the other side where users with less experience may end up in a bad path, and we will want to be defensive instead. As discussed above, the expected returns are still insane – 5% per month with 2x implies more than 10% per month, and more than doubling the money in a year – even more considering the low risk involved.
